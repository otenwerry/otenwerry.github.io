            <p>
                My name is Owen and I’m a junior studying computer science at 
                Columbia. I’m interested in math and philosophy as well, and I 
                am co-president of Columbia’s Effective Altruism Society. I 
                believe that we can do a lot of good for both ourselves and 
                others through careful, systematic thinking.
            </p>

                This website exists to keep track of what I’ve been working on 
                and thinking about. GitHub + contact information linked below.

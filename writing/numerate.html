            Sometimes liberals make arguments that are clearly incoherent in the face of simple numerical realities. Worse, within the communities where this happens, these arguments are treated not very differently from better ones that gesture at the same sentiments while also being correct. It seems to me that in a healthy political culture, innumerate arguments should get recognized as such, and are not tolerated simply because they signal affiliation with some set of ideas.

            There are a lot of things people will tell you not to do in the name of protecting the environment. A number of people I know subscribe to the idea that you shouldn’t use AI for this reason. One ChatGPT prompt consumes 3 Watt-hours of electricity, as an <a href="https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-much-energy-does-chatgpt-use" target="_blank">overestimate</a>. Per <a href="https://andymasley.substack.com/p/a-cheat-sheet-for-conversations-about" target="_blank">Andy Masley</a> (this whole article is good and I like to show it to people), the average American uses 10,000 times this per day – if you prompt ChatGPT one hundred times per day, this would only account for 1% of your energy use. Twitter complains about a Texas data center using 463 million gallons of water; in reality, data centers combine for <a href="https://x.com/StatisticUrban/status/1951284890990944732" target="_blank">less than</a> 0.01% of the state’s total water usage. The UK government <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-drought-group-meets-to-address-nationally-significant-water-shortfall" target="_blank">officially recommends</a> deleting old emails and pictures to save water. Whether this makes sense is left as an exercise for the reader.

            A similar bizarre phenomenon is the way people will disparage the talents of obviously talented people they don’t like, to make the point “I don’t like this person.” People call Elon Musk stupid and lucky, say that he was born rich, that his accomplishments aren’t impressive because of this. His father gave him <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Musk" target="_blank">$28,000</a> to found his first company, and likely paid his tuition and so on – this is certainly an advantage, but not one that explains becoming the world’s richest person! Not a single other person in the world has taken similar privileges and turned them into over $400 billion; not many have even turned them into $1 billion. Elon was CEO of PayPal, founded SpaceX, led early investing in Tesla and became CEO, co-founded OpenAI, founded xAI and acquired Twitter, arguably influenced the outcome of the 2024 election through an intense Pennsylvania campaign, and created a new government department for himself to lead. You can disapprove of his character, but to say he’s not talented is to close your eyes to the statistical reality that it is basically impossible to stumble your way into that much power.

            Another example is the common sentiment that CEOs of big companies get paid too much. While executive salaries can be eye-popping, they often just don’t bottom out in any sort of impact on the company’s employees. If you distributed the Amazon CEO’s total 2024 compensation of $40.1 million across the company, everybody would have taken home an extra $25 that year. There are certainly cases where a redistribution could actually make a difference for employees – the Walton family’s yearly dividends add up to something like $1,600 per employee – but in general, you can’t just point at a big number and call someone a robber baron, when they have hundreds of thousands or even millions of people on their payroll.

            In many of these cases, I don’t even think you need to know any concrete facts in order to recognize innumeracy. All you need is a mental model of physical reality that has a calibrated sense of scale. Without numbers, I still could have told you that it doesn’t make sense to avoid using ChatGPT for environmental reasons, because it is intuitive to me that a computer operation that doesn’t cost me money cannot have any major physical ramifications. I don’t need to know any statistics to be confident that Elon Musk has internal qualities that are, in some relevant sense, exceptional.

            I don’t have a higher point to make beyond that it is bad that so many people who consider themselves politically engaged lack the numerical intuition to spot obvious falsehoods. I would much prefer to live in a political culture where, if you bemoan President Trump’s disinterest in the truth and then turn around and say these sorts of things, the rest of the community has the sense and the courage to point this out.

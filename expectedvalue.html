        <h1>Expected Value Maximization in Extreme Cases</h1>
        <p>
          The decision theory framework developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern 
          gives a way, under particular conditions, to pick the better of two actions with 
          uncertain outcomes by evaluating the “expected value” of each action, and picking 
          the one with the higher EV. In particular, suppose we have a set \( Z \) of outcomes, 
          and a set \(P\) of probability functions \(p: Z \to [0,1]\). Here, elements of \(P\) 
          represent 
          actions. If I take the action associated with \(p \in P\) , I don’t know for sure what 
          outcome it will lead to, but I do know that the probability it leads to any
          outcome \(z\) is \(p(z)\). When we have such sets \(Z\) and \(P\), the 
          von Neumann-Morgenstern
          Representation Theorem tells us that a preference relation \(\le\) defined on \(P\) 
          satisfying the Substitution and Archimedean Axioms (defined later) is necessary 
          and sufficient for the existence of a utility function \(u: Z \to \mathbb{R}\) such that 
          \[
            p \le q \text{ if and only if } \sum_{z \in Z}p(z)u(z) \le \sum_{z \in Z}q(z)u(z).
          \] 
          (Note that the former \(\le\) is the 
          preference relation, while the latter \(\le\) is the total order relation defined on 
          \(\mathbb{R}\).) 
          That is, if we have probability functions \(p\) and \(q\), i.e. actions, and we have a 
          preference relation defined on our set of actions that satisfies the two axioms, 
          we can figure out what the preference relation says we should do by figuring out 
          the appropriate utility function \(u\), and then computing the expected values of 
          each probability function with respect to that utility function. We will 
          write \(\mathbb{E}(p(x))\) to mean the expected utility \(\sum_{z \in Z}p(z)u(z)\).
